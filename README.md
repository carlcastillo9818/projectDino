a new game project made by the Cranatis team (currently myself and my team member Rania) and utilizing Phaser3 w/ Javascript. This game involves dinosaurs, robots, time travel and it is a 2D platformer game that is playable in the web browser like our previous game Azetude.  This game will utilize keyboard controls to control the main character.
